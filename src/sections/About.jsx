I translate requirements into clear domain models, pick the right stack, and deliver responsive, polished interfaces (React/Vue + TypeScript, GSAP/Framer Motion) backed by secure, efficient APIs (Node.js/Express, REST/GraphQL, Auth/RBAC) and optimized data layers (PostgreSQL/MySQL/Mongo via Prisma). I use Strapi for content workflows and n8n for automation/integration so teams move faster.

On the ops side, I set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions), containerize with Docker, and run on VPS/cloud with Nginx, SSL, and caching. Observability with Prometheus/Grafana and structured logging keeps performance predictable and incidents short. The goal is simple: ship quickly, stay reliable, and leave a codebase the team enjoys maintaining.`,
